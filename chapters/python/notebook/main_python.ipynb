    "In this chapter we cover some aspects of how to write (good) Python code. As you might have discovered tasks can be solved in many different ways in Python. This is clearly a strength because you would most likely be able to solve any task thrown at you. On the other hand it is a weakness, because code can get messy and hard to follow, especially if you solve the same task in different part of your code using different libraries or syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter I will explain how I tend to solve some common tasks, in this process we will also cover some stuff that you should know. If you need more information on each topic below, there are plenty of online sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code examples are meant as an inspiration, and maybe you do not agree and have solutions that you think are much better. If that is the case I would love to know, and I can update this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speed and readability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people are concerned about speed or execution time. My advice is to focus on readable code, and get the job done. When the code is working it is very easy to go back and change out parts that are slow. Particularly you can use the magic commands `%timeit` to check performance of different functions. There is also the option of using [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), which translate python code into optimized machine code.\n",

    "# Personal Guidelines\n",
    "It is important to have a some guidelines when coding, and for Python there are clear style guides [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Take a look at the official guidelines, and  make some specific rules for yourself, and stick to them. The reason for this is that if you make a large code, people will recognize your style and it is easier to understand the code. If you are working in team, it is even more important - try to agree on some basic rules, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Guidelines:**\n",
    "* Variable names should be meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naming of variables and functions, should you write `def my_fynction(...):` or `def MyFunction(..)`, i.e are words separated by underscore or capital letter. Personally I use capital letters for class definition, and underscore for function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Almost) always use doc string, you would be amazed how easy it is to forget what a function does. Shorter (private) functions usually do not need comments or doc strings, *if you use good variable names* - it should then be easy to understand what is happening by just looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inline comments should be used sparingly, only where strictly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strive to make code general, in particular not type specific. In Python it is easy to make functions that will work if a list (array) or a single value is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use exception handling, in particular for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself [[thomas2019pragmatic]](#thomas2019pragmatic). If you need to change the code more than one place to extend it, you will forget.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The DRY principle also applies to *knowledge sharing*, it is not only about copy and paste line of code, but knowledge should only be represented in one place. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Import libraries using the syntax `import library as ..`, Numpy would typically be `import numpy as np`. The syntax `from numpy import *` could lead to conflicts between modules as functions could have the same name in two different modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work Guidelines:**\n",
    "* Do not copy and paste code without understanding it. It is OK to be inspired of others, but in some cases the code example are unnecessary complicates, but perhaps more important you will get a code with a mix of different styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stick to a limited number of libraries, I try to do as much as possible with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I only do plotting with Matplotlib, and do not use the build in functionality of Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unexpected behavior of functions, functions should be able to discover if something are wrong with arguments, and give warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code editor\n",
    "You would like to use an editor that gives you some help. It is particularly useful when you do not remember a variable or function name, you can guess at the name and a drop down list will appear which will let you pick the name or function you want. If you enter  a function name, the editor will write some useful information about the function, some screenshots are shown in [figure](#fig:py:vscode).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- dom:FIGURE: [fig-python/vscode.png, width=400 frac=1.0] A screenshot of vscode (left) the editor helps to identify which variable name you mean, (right) the editor show relevant of the function you would like to call. <div id=\"fig:py:vscode\"></div> -->\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- end figure -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently my favorite editor is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it can be used for any language, and there are a lot of add ins that can be installed to make the coding experience more pleasant. Spyder is also a very good alternative, but this editor is mainly for Python. It takes some time to learn how an editor work, so it is good if it can be used for multiple purposes.  However, always be open to new ideas and products, it will only make you more efficient. As an example, in some cases you will have a particular difficult error in the code, and then it could help to open and run that code in a different editor, you might get a slightly different error messages, which could help you locate the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types in Python\n",
    "In Python you do not need to define types as in a compiled language, this an advantage as you need to do less writing, and it is also easier to create functions that will work with any kind of type. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic types\n",
    "I will assume that you are familiar with the common types like floats (for real numbers), strings (text, lines, word, a character), integer (whole numbers), Boolean (True, False). What is sometimes useful is to be able to test what kind of type a variable is, this can be done with `type()`"
