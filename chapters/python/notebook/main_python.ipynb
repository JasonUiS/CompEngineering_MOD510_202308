    "\n",
    "Here will try to cover both some key syntax, and some aspects of how to write (good) Python code. As you might have discovered tasks can be solved in many different ways in Python. This is clearly a strength because you would most likely be able to solve any task thrown at you. On the other hand it is a weakness, because code can get messy and hard to follow, especially if you solve the same task in different part of your code using different libraries or syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people are concerned about speed or execution time. My advice is to focus on readable code, and get the job done. When the code is working it is very easy to go back and change out parts that are slow. Remember that you should test the code on big problems, sometimes the advantage of Numpy or Scipy is not seen before the system is large. You can use the magic commands `%timeit` to check performance of different functions. There is also the option of using [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), which translate python code into optimized machine code.\n",

    "# Personal Guidelines\n",
    "It is important to have a some guidelines when coding, and for Python there are clear style guides [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Take a look at the official guidelines, and  make some specific rules for yourself, and stick to them. The reason for this is that if you make a large code, people will recognize your style and it is easier to understand the code. If you are working in team, it is even more important - try to agree on some basic rules, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Guidelines:**\n",
    "* Variable names should be meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naming of variables and functions, should you write `def my_fynction(...):` or `def MyFunction(..)`, i.e are words separated by underscore or capital letter. Personally I use capital letters for class definition, and underscore for function definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* (Almost) always use doc string, you would be amazed how easy it is to forget what a function does. Shorter (private) functions usually do not need comments or doc strings, if you use good variable names - it should then be easy to understand what is happening by just looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inline comments should be used sparingly, only where strictly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strive to make code general, in particular not type specific, e.g. in Python it is easy to make functions that will work if a list (array) or a single value is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use exception handling, in particular for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DRY - Do not Repeat Yourself [[thomas2019pragmatic]](#thomas2019pragmatic). If you need to change the code more than one place to extend it, you will forget to change everywhere and introduce bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The DRY principle also applies to *knowledge sharing*, it is not only about copy and paste line of code, but knowledge should only be represented in one place. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Import libraries using the syntax `import library as ..`, Numpy would typically be `import numpy as np`. The syntax `from numpy import *` could lead to conflicts between modules as functions could have the same name in two different modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work Guidelines:**\n",
    "* Do not copy and paste code without understanding it. It is OK to be inspired of others, but in some cases the code example are unnecessary complicated, but perhaps more important you will get a code with a mix of different styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stick to a limited number of libraries, I try to do as much as possible with [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unexpected behavior of functions, functions should be able to discover if something are wrong with arguments, and give warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code editor\n",
    "You would like to use an editor that gives you some help. It is particularly useful when you do not remember a variable or function name, you can guess at the name and a drop down list will appear which will let you pick the name or function you want. If you enter  a function name, the editor will write some useful information about the function, some screenshots are shown in [figure](#fig:py:vscode).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- dom:FIGURE: [fig-python/vscode.png, width=800 frac=1.0] A screenshot of vscode (left) the editor helps to identify which variable name you mean, (right) the editor show relevant of the function you would like to call. <div id=\"fig:py:vscode\"></div> -->\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- end figure -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently my favorite editor is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it can be used for any language, and there are a lot of add ins that can be installed to make the coding experience more pleasant. Spyder is also a very good alternative, but this editor is mainly for Python. It takes some time to learn how an editor work, so it is good if it can be used for multiple purposes.  However, always be open to new ideas and products, it will only make you more efficient. As an example, in some cases you will have a particular difficult error in the code, and then it could help to open and run that code in a different editor, you might get a slightly different error messages, which could help you locate the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types in Python\n",
    "In Python you do not need to define types as in a compiled language. In many ways one can say that Python only has *one* type.  To not define types is generally and advantage as it lets you write code with fewer lines, and it is easier to write functions that will work with any kind of type. As an example in the programming language C, if you want to write a function that lets you add two numbers, you have to write one version if the arguments are integers and one version if the arguments are floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that Python store and organize data is called a data model, and it is very well described in the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html). The important point is that all data in Python is an object or a relation between objects. The `is` operator can be used to check if two objects have the same identity, that means they are the same object. The `id` operator gives an unique integer value for the object and if two objects has the same number they are the same object, e.g."

This place could be deep into some other library that you have no knowledge of. \n",

This also explains that if you use the `np.append(x,some_value)` inside a function where `x` is large it could slow down your code, because the program has to delete `x` and create a new very large box each time it would want to add a new element. A better way to do it is to create `x` *large enough* in the beginning, and then just assign values `x[i]=a`. \n",

    "## Mutable and immutable objects\n",
    "What we have explained in the previous section is related to what is known as mutable and immutable objects. These terms are used to describe objects that has an internal state that can be changed (mutable) and objects that has an internal state that cannot be changed after they have been created. Example of mutable objects are lists, dictionaries, and arrays, examples of immutable objects are floats, ints, tuples, and strings. Thus if we create the number 10 its value cannot be changed (and why would we do that?). Note that that is *not the same as saying that*  `x=10` and that the internal state of `x` cannot change, this is *not* true. We are allowed to make `x` reference another object. If we do `x=10`, then `x is 10` will give true and the will have the same value if we use the `id` operator on `x` and `10`. If we later say that `a=11` then `a is 10` will give false and `id(a)` and `id(10)` give different values, but *`id(10)` will have the same value as before*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable objects, and once a list is created we can change the content without changing the reference to that object. That is why the operations `x=[]` and `x.append(1)`, does not change the id of x, and also explain that if we put `y=x`, `y` would change if `x` is changed. Contrary to immutable objects if `x=[]`, and `y=[]` then `x is y` will give false. Thus, whenever you create a list it will be an unique object.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**A final tip.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are bound to get into strange, unwanted behavior when working with lists, arrays and dictionaries (mutable) objects in Python. Whenever, you are unsure, just make a simple version of your lists and perform some of the operations on them to investigate if the behavior is what you want.\n",
    "\n",
