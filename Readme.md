In this repository you can find the material for the MOD510 Computational Engineering and Modeling at University of Stavanger, Norway. The purpose of the book is to explain how computers solve mathematical models.
Many of the most common numerical methods is presented, we show how to implement them in Python, and discuss the limitations.
The mathematical formalism is kept (or an attempt has been made to keep it) to a minimum. All the material is available at
"github":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering". For each of the chapter there is a Jupyter "notebook":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters". This makes it possible to run all the codes in this document.
We strongly recommend to install Python from "Anaconda":"https://www.anaconda.com/". All documents have been prepared using "doconce":"https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters".
