# Computational Engineering
In this repository you can find the material for the MOD510 Computational Engineering and Modeling at University of Stavanger, Norway. The purpose of the book is to explain how computers solve mathematical models.
Many of the most common numerical methods is presented, we show how to implement them in Python, and discuss the limitations.
The mathematical formalism is kept (or an attempt has been made to keep it) to a minimum. All the material is available at
[github]("https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering"). For each of the chapter there is a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/pub/chapters). This makes it possible to run all the codes in the book.

It is hard to learn a programming language without a concrete problem to solve. Much of the learning outcome in this course arrives from working on projects. To get started, check out the [COVID-19 project](https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/tree/master/projects/covid19). A full solution, can be found [here](https://github.com/ahiorth/CompEngineering/blob/master/projects/covid19_solution/notebook/covid19_solution.ipynb).

We strongly recommend to install Python from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 

All documents have been prepared using [doconce](https://github.com/doconce/doconce).
